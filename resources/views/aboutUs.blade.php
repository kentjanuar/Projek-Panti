    <h2 class="text-lg my-5 font-semibold w-full text-center">HISTORY</h2>
    <div class="container w-3/5">
        <p class="text-lg my-5 text-justify">
            Yayasan Rumah Bersinar was established due to concerns about the condition and situation of the nation, specifically the lack of equality in economic and educational fields, where many children in some regions of Indonesia are born into families below the poverty line and have minimal access to education, resulting in a less competitive workforce.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg my-5 text-justify">
            Based on these concerns, Yayasan Rumah Bersinar established an orphanage specifically to facilitate underprivileged, orphaned, school dropout, and pre-welfare children from areas with limited access to formal and non-formal education, especially in the 3T (Underdeveloped, Frontier, and Outermost) regions of Indonesia.        
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg my-5 text-justify">
            Yayasan Rumah Bersinar began this effort by establishing the Rumah Bersinar Orphanage, facilitating 12 children from Papua and West Papua since 2019, and in 2021 added one orphanage unit facilitating 13 children from South Nias Regency named Saluran Berkat Orphanage. In June 2022, Yayasan Rumah Bersinar added one orphanage unit facilitating 13 children from the Talaud Islands Regency named Tuhan Baik Orphanage. The selected children are prioritized to be orphaned, school dropouts, and pre-welfare with the aim for this program to be more effectively targeted. Considering the high demand from the Nias Island area, in June 2023, Yayasan Rumah Bersinar added 1 orphanage unit facilitating 12 children from West Nias Regency and partly from South Nias Regency named Saluran Kasih Orphanage, but this time Yayasan Rumah Bersinar placed this unit in Sidoarjo considering the relatively cheaper house rental costs.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg my-5 text-justify">
            For the funding of this effort, Yayasan Rumah Bersinar has not yet had a permanent sponsor but started with donations from the foundation’s management and opened opportunities for the general public to support in various forms such as groceries, food, daily necessities, funds, etc. All of which are received and managed directly by the Caretakers and children so that donors can see that their contributions reach and are directly felt by the children. Thankfully, over time, some donors have started to donate regularly, but it can be said that the amount is still far from sufficient, so the Foundation’s management also endeavors to run several side businesses to support, like a refill drinking water business and meat delivery service. However, the results are still limited and merely help finance the children’s extracurricular activities transportation.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg my-5 text-justify">
            Yayasan Rumah Bersinar will strive to the best of its ability to carry out this social mission, but it must be acknowledged that this institution cannot operate alone to achieve these goals. Much support is needed from the wider community who share the same vision and care about these goals. Prayer support is primary because this task is related to human life and aligns with the goals of the Indonesian nation, which is to participate in the equalization of education and the quality of human resources. Support in manpower is needed in the form of volunteers who share the vision in giving a touch of love to these children far from their families and hometowns. And also, adequate financial support according to the needs and decent living for these children.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg my-5 text-justify">
            Our hope and prayer are that you, sir, madam, and siblings, support us and work together with us in realizing these children’s dreams for their future and this nation.
        </p>

    <h2 class="text-lg my-5 font-semibold w-full text-center">VISION</h2>
    <div class="container w-3/5">
        <p class="text-lg my-5 text-justify">
        To participate in enlightening the life of the nation and improving the welfare of the community as well as enhancing the quality of human resources, specifically for underprivileged, orphaned, pre-welfare children from 3T areas (Frontier, Outermost, and Underdeveloped) in the Republic of Indonesia.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-lg my-5 font-semibold w-full text-center">MISSION</h2>
    <div class="container w-3/5">
        <p class="text-lg my-5 text-justify">
            To establish orphanages with a substitute parent/family system and facilitate livelihood and education for underprivileged, orphaned, pre-welfare children from 3T areas (Frontier, Outermost, and Underdeveloped) in the Republic of Indonesia.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg my-5 text-justify">
            To equip the orphanage children with education in discipline, mentality, spirituality, soft skills, and talent development in various fields pursued.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg my-5 text-justify">
            Due to our reliance so far on inconsistent offerings/donations from the Foundation’s Management and Donors, fulfilling the educational and living needs of the Orphanage children highly depends on the availability of funds. Therefore, if the needs are not met, certain items are reduced or their payments postponed. This significantly affects the quality of life and education obtained, making it less than optimal. We need full support so that the quality of life and education of these children can be maximized.
